# Go Learning Journey üöÄ

[![Go Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Go-1.x-00ADD8?style=flat-square&logo=go)](https://golang.org)

## Overview

This repository documents my journey learning Go (Golang), exploring its unique features and comparing it with other programming languages. As a developer with experience in TypeScript and other languages, this project represents my first steps into Go's ecosystem.

## What I've Learned

### Core Concepts

- Variable declarations and type system
- Control structures and flow control
- Functions and methods
- Error handling patterns
- Basic data structures (arrays, slices, maps)
- Structs and interfaces
- Concurrency basics with goroutines

### Language Comparisons

I've explored how Go differs from other languages:

- **vs TypeScript**: Static typing approach, structural differences
- **vs Java**: Simplicity, compilation, and memory management
- **vs C++**: Performance characteristics and memory safety
- **vs Node.js**: Concurrency model and execution environment

### Code Examples

```go
// Basic Hello World with variable declaration
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    name := "Yuri"
    fmt.Println("Hello, my name is", name)
}
```

## Project Structure

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.go         # Main application file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md       # Project documentation
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.x or higher
- Basic understanding of programming concepts

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-hello-world.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd go-hello-world
```

3. Run the program:
```bash
go run main.go
```

## Key Takeaways

- Go's simplicity and effectiveness in system programming
- Strong built-in concurrency support
- Efficient compilation and execution
- Clean and readable syntax
- Excellent standard library

## Future Learning Goals

- [ ] Advanced concurrency patterns
- [ ] Building web services with Go
- [ ] Testing in Go
- [ ] Working with databases
- [ ] Microservices architecture
